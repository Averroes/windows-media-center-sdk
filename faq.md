## <a name="version-compatibility"></a>This doesn't run on Windows [Insert Version Here]. Why not?

The Windows Media Center SDK for Windows 7 was designed to run on Windows 7 Home Premium and Ultimate as these were the versions which contained the proper prerequisites, namely `ehShell.exe` and supporting binaries. It was never intended to run on later versions of Windows (noting it _likely_ ran on Windows 8 SKUs which had Windows Media Center enabled and all reports indicate it was binary compatible with the version that shipped with Windows 7). Microsoft discontinued the Windows Media Center feature and did not ship it with Windows 10.
