# PowerPlaylist 2 for Windows Media Center in Windows 7 Now Available

I finished up fixing the last few bugs for PowerPlaylist 2 for Windows Media Center in Windows 7 and posted the installer and source to http://www.codeplex.com/powerplaylist. PowerPlaylist adds a start menu strip with up to five tiles to Windows Media Center in Windows 7. Each tile represents an audio, slideshow and / or visualization combination which will start when the tile is selected and is highly customizable by the consumer resulting in a highly personalized Windows Media Center experience.

Also included is the PowerPlaylist Editor which makes it really easy to modify the start menu strip name and individual tiles.

Enjoy!
