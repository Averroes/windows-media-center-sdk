What's in the folders in this zip file?

\SampleExplorer
---------------------------------

Source code for the Sample Explorer application (\Sampler) you find in the Extras Library after installing the SDK as well as the desktop browsing tool (\McmlSourceViewer). This is a good example of one approach for creating a testing / automation framework for your own application.

Note: These were created with the free of charge Visual C# 2008 Express Edition but should compile fine with other Visual Studio 2008 SKUs.

\Samples
---------------------------------

A couple of new and updated samples for the SDK. The changed files now point to http://retrosight.com (the prior location has gone offline).

- FunTimeAndDate.mcml - In the final stages of Windows 7 development we thought about including this by default in the Extras Library -- it didn't make the cut. A great example of cutting and pasting from other samples to come up with a small yet useful applet.
- WebDataPut.mcml - An example of how to use the Put verb with Data Access Model Items. It's non-functional unless you create the web service on the other side of the equation.

Copy the contents of this folder to {SDK Install Path}\Samples\Sampler\ folder choosing to replace the files already present.

\Templates
---------------------------------

Complete source for the Visual Studio 2008 templates included with the SDK.

\Tools
---------------------------------

Complete source for...

- Animation Explorer (\McmlAnimationExplorer)
- Preview Tool Launcher (\McmlPadAuto) -- Form1.cs in this source is particularly interesting from an automation standpoint and useful in writing authoring tools.

Note: These were created with the free of charge Visual C# 2008 Express Edition but should compile fine with other Visual Studio 2008 SKUs.

\Veronicas Radio
---------------------------------

Markup for the Veronicas Radio web application.

\WebAppInstallerTemplate
---------------------------------

Follow the instructions in Readme.txt to create an installer for a purely web application.
